                    King for a day is the most popular song made by Pierce the Veil, This song is from their most recent ablum called Collide with the Sky
                    <br>
                    It's a song about being the underdog or the person being looked down upon and treated poorly by people more powerful than you, that people who think they have the right to do so, even though they don't even know you
                    <br><br>
                    quoting the lead singer Vic Fuentes "We felt that a lot being in the band, and getting treated as if your not important," he continued. "The song conveys the anger that stems from being treated that way, and fighting back."

                A Match Into Water is my favourite song made by Pierce The Veil.
                <br>
                the song is about Front man Vic Fuentes singing and screaming the lyrics in angst, calling out to God, the world, anyone who will listen to his pain
                <br><br>
                the song is written for Vics ex girlfriend Cara,Cara had cancer during the making of the song
                <br>
                in the song he goes back and forth between feeling hope and feeling no hope
